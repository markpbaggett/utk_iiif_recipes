Multiple A/V Files on Single Canvas
===================================

About
-----
It is common to have A/V content split into multiple files. This recipe shows how to model such content using one single
Canvas. The advantage of using one single Canvas is continuous playback across the files, with the viewer reporting the
sum duration of the files, thus providing the user with a cohesive viewing/listening experience.

This page describes how we plan to serve multiple AV files on a single canvas in our future repository. This specific
feature is critical to cleaning up user experience for our World War II Oral Histories.
