UTK IIIF Cookbook
=================

This repository includes efforts to think about how to model our current content in IIIF presentation v3.

While the IIIF community maintains its own cookbook, its purpose is different.  That cookbook attempts to help 
inform applications consuming or writing IIIF manifests.  This cookbook is to help us think about how our current data 
and content models should look in IIIF presentation 3 and associated viewers.
