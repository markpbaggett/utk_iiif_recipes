WEBVTT

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.970
[Ken Wise (INTERVIEWER)]: Today is March 13, 2020, and we

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.640
are located in the John C. Hodges Library at the

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.770
University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.340
As part of the Rising from the Ashes Chimney Tops

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.700
II Wildfires Oral History Project, today we have

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.540
the honor of interviewing John Schwartz and Salley Reamer

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.420
regarding their experiences during and after the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.710
Chimney Tops II Wildfires in 2016. My name is Ken

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.960
Wise, and I will be conducting today's interview

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.950
with John and Salley. Thank you so much for your

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.900
willingness to share your story with us. And let's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.720
start out with each of you stating your name and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.300
your relation here with the University of Tennessee.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.890
[John Schwartz (NARRATOR 1)]: Okay, I guess I'll start. I'm a professor in the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.410
Water in the Civil and Environmental

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.980
Engineering Department, but I'm also the Water

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.080
Director for the Tennessee Water Resources

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.990
Research Center that's also here on campus.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.270
I've been at the University of Tennessee since

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.020
2003 in the department and worked my

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.380
way through tenure and to a full professor. And

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.970
that's why I'm here today. [Salley Reamer (NARRATOR 2]: My name's Salley Reamer,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.890
and I started in 2018 on a master's degree in the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.110
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.540
at UT, and Dr. Schwartz is my major advisor. [INTERVIEWER]: Okay,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.150
well first question, can you kind of just give a reason why you

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.680
agreed to do this interview with us?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.550
[NARRATOR 1]: Well I think it's an interesting project that

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.380
I think when we look back on it in years it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.420
will reflect on the event and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.190
people will have a lot of questions. So this will

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.030
help them understand what happened. [NARRATOR 2]: I agree

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.080
that it will be important. [INTERVIEWER]: All right, thank you. All

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.120
right could each of you explain just a little, John you sort of told us your history

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.570
of being here, but could you Salley tell us how long

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.560
you've been here in this area, and familiarized

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.920
yourself with East Tennessee and the Smokies area? [NARRATOR 2]: So

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.740
actually I'd never been to Knoxville until two years

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.130
ago, so I'm really new to the area. I just moved

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.190
here from South Carolina for graduate school.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.490
So a more limited experience in the area. [INTERVIEWER]: So you've

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.150
been here for two years and that's your familiarity, and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.560
you've been here for several years as a student.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.540
So, I want to talk a little bit about the days leading

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.920
up to this fire. When did each of you first become

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.030
aware that there was a fire in the Smokies? [NARRATOR 1]: Well, I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.060
guess since you were in South Carolina and I was

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.090
here, I heard it, well since I do research in the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.730
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, so since

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.360
I really have been here, I do the water

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.420
quality analysis for the Smoky Mountains.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.000
And so we have a high elevation research site up

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.690
by Clingman's Dome. And so our students, my students

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.330
over the years, it was a different student at the time

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.600
than Salley. We had a research group meeting that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
day, and then he was supposed to go up to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.340
Clingman's Dome to our research site, but then we

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.310
we have communications with the park, and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.160
they said that, "no, there's a fire going on," and

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.130
I didn't really realize how serious it was at

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.240
that time. And they said, "well, the road's closed. You

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.120
can't get up there." And so then it wasn't

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.030
really until the evening, I heard it on NPR

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.460
that the fire really excavated and that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.770
they were basically telling people that

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.860
they needed to leave. Actually for

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.260
us, actually we had some good friends that have a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.020
second home up in the Ski Mountain area. And so we

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.230
called them on the phone and said, "did you hear on

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.170
NPR? You need to get, you need to get out of there."

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.080
So they they actually got in the car to leave, but

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.600
then the road was so clogged with people they

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.940
basically, they went back to their their home and

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.050
just hoped that it didn't

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.690
get them. [INTERVIEWER]: Apparently it didn't. [NARRATOR 1]: No, they were okay. Yeah.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.740
[INTERVIEWER]: So tell me what your reactions are when you first heard

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.260
about this fire getting out of control.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.740
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, you know, really since their not, wildfires

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.440
in this area aren't really that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.380
prevalent, that I didn't really know what

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.830
to think. Actually, you know, it seemed pretty

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.160
serious or just unbelievable in a way. But that

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.700
was kind of, and until you see it, so like

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.430
after the aftermath, and then you see it, then you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.660
realize, like wow, holy cow. That was a pretty

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.970
big event. But while is was happening it was

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.760
hard to imagine. We don't have a TV, so I

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.440
didn't see any visual images. [INTERVIEWER]: Oh okay so just NPR was your only. [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah, radio.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.980
Right. [INTERVIEWER]: And your phone call. So when you make a phone call,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.450
what did your friend tell you he was seeing out the window?

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.530
[NARRATOR 1]: He said it looked like there was fire all over the place. And

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.750
so, yeah, it was hard for them to describe.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.060
And I think they realized it was

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.920
pretty serious, but then, too,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.680
I don't know what they were thinking

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.890
exactly, but they would have, if they could

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.310
have left they would have came back to

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.880
Knoxville. But with the roads being so jammed with

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.390
people that they decided just to go back. [INTERVIEWER]: So

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.260
when did you first see the results of the fire?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.830
[NARRATOR 1]: That was probably about a month afterwards or

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.470
something like that. So I had a meeting

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.620
with the park up there because I meet with them

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.880
regularly because of my research. And

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.530
then driving, it's that bypass road, that's

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.460
where you first see it coming in.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.240
And so, it meant it looked pretty bad. And then there

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.490
was a there's another road, I forget the name of

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.390
it, but where the hotel... There was a hotel that

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.550
was up there that was burned down. Did you go up

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.920
and do samples up in that area? [NARRATOR 2]: A little bit.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.260
[NARRATOR 1]: Yeah. [NARRATOR 2]: I can't remember the name. [INTERVIEWER]: And, what did you think? [NARRATOR 1]: Well, I thought it was

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.310
pretty catastrophic.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.000
Yeah, I think probably afterwards just the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.710
loss of life, I think is probably the thing that

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.460
was the worst thing about the whole thing and that...

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.000
[INTERVIEWER]: So the question here becomes once you've

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.730
seen this fire, and you've seen the results of it,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.600
what did that prompt you to think about in terms of your research? Well, maybe

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.570
you should describe what your research that you've been doing

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.480
in the park is before you get to that question. [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah, I

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.880
think that's a good background for us because

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.750
I mean, it kind of, sets the stage.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.850
I think everybody knows through news that

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.170
most of the wildfires in the country really occur

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.400
out west. And the majority of research that

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.150
has gone on about fire and the impacts of fire on

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.240
ecosystems and the environment really is from studies

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.750
that have occurred out west. And so really there

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.810
has been, well there's only been a few

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.780
studies that have occurred in eastern United

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.200
States, so this was for us a unique

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.620
opportunity to see what the potential impacts

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.990
of fire is on ecosystems, and particularly the

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.000
Great Smoky Mountains National Park because it's a

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.400
natural area, right, so it's not having any other

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.210
impacts from you know from humans and other

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.590
alterations. But to go back, for us it's

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.250
particularly our interest is because my research

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.650
with water quality sampling the Great Smoky

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.320
Mountains National Park comes from the fact that

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.280
the streams up there are affected by air pollution.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.000
So the coal fired plants like Kingston Power

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.150
Plant, Bull Run and other power plants around the

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.180
east they, historically they put a lot of

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.530
sulfur up in the atmosphere. It comes down as, when

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.810
it's not even raining, the

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.540
particulates get trapped onto the leaves of the

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.120
forest. And when it rains it comes down into the

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.100
soils and then it ultimately comes into the

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.910
streams and the streams have very low pH in a

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.000
lot of areas. Also too, is that our research has

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.380
shown that the amount of sulfur in the stream

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.840
water has remained pretty much constant over these

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.800
years, so the soil acts like a big sponge for this

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.760
sulfur. And so what we were concerned about is if

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.290
with the fire, is that if all that sulfur is in that

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.770
soil layer is the fire would that release a large

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.170
amount of sulfur? And we see actually a

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.930
major response. But it's almost an

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.330
additional effect of this air pollution problem

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.640
that has occurred over the decades. So that was

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.070
for us really the interesting part of our

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.580
research, was to understand a) fire in

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.440
eastern United States which was not very well

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.860
known but also an area that's been impacted by air

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.200
pollution, acid rain basically, for decades.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.840
[INTERVIEWER]: Salley let me ask you, you're doing this research with John. Can you describe

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.880
specifically what you did and what your interest is, and what

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.200
you were seeing when you first started on this project?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.020
[NARRATOR 2]: Yeah. So like I said I started in 2018, and the

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.240
project was lined up when I got here.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.610
They've decided soil sampling sites and

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.900
the scope of the project and what we were going to

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.280
look at. But it involved soil sampling in the park

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.780
at different sites and varying levels of burn. So

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.780
some sites for reference control sites that

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.810
weren't burned at all. And then up to areas that

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.560
were classified as a high burn status. So in those

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.620
areas there is very low vegetation. And the soil is

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.350
black and charred looking. So it was

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.590
pretty crazy to see those high burn areas

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.170
especially in the park. And then just analyzing

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.860
all the samples collected for a lot of different

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.220
parameters for the soils as well as the stream

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.920
samples that we've collected to look at them, to

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.660
compare them to the data before the fire, after the

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.140
fire, and then also by the burn level to

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.290
see what the impacts were in those areas that were a

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.810
low-moderate burn compared to the high burn

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.420
severity. [INTERVIEWER]: So what kind of impact were you looking

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.150
for? Impact... John mentioned something about the sulfur

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:24.310
content. What else were you looking for in terms of what

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.350
impact that the fire had? [NARRATOR 2]: So we were looking, a main goal

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.640
of the project was put together kind of a

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.520
characterization just of what happens after a

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.000
wildfire in the eastern environment, especially in

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.420
an acidic and humid environment where fires are

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.070
really rare. So just to put together a battery of

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.490
parameters and what what their levels were after a

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.700
fire in this environment, just in case something

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.580
were to happen in the future. Kind of what to

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.040
expect in that kind of thing. So we did test a lot

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.820
of parameters besides just the sulfur. But we also

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.970
wanted to look at the impacts as they compared to

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.750
what's been seen on the West Coast. Just to see if

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.510
the environment here responds differently to fire

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.370
than areas in California, Oregon, out west that have

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.190
been studied before. [INTERVIEWER]: Well let me come back to that

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.540
minute. Let's get back to this sponge effect of the

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.770
soil and the sulfur What did the two of you find when you look at the

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:33.070
streams? Did the fire release the sulfur or did it have no

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.780
effect? [NARRATOR 1]: Well, this is the interesting thing is that

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.400
there were some changes in sulfur, but we didn't

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.870
see, I think we actually, that there was a

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.180
decrease in sulfur in the stream, which was

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:58.120
kind of not expected. But that's, but then we

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.480
also, Salley also measured total sulfur. This is

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.910
maybe getting a little technical, but so sulfur

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.060
takes multiple forms. And then, so in the stream we

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:12.400
look at sulfate because it's the acidic element.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.780
But we think that a lot of the sulfur

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:21.240
that was burned in the fire

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:25.210
stayed in a reduced state, so it didn't get

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.910
converted to sulfate. And so we do think there

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.400
was a lot of sulfate that left because your

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.360
data showed that the total sulfur was removed, but

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.850
it wasn't remove as sulfate to cause

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.640
acidification. But I think the interesting thing

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.850
that we found was that we did see also a release of

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.380
what we call base CAD ions, which are a sum

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.430
calcium and magnesium and potassium and sodium for

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.240
the most part. So these are all positively charged

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.100
ions. And they cling to soil

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.450
particles as well. We saw that that was

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.480
released and that actually had a change in the

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.990
stream chemistry is what we saw. [INTERVIEWER]: So it was

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.000
released stream [NARRATOR 1 and 2]: Mm hmm. [INTERVIEWER]: And what effect did

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.970
that release on the water? Good, bad, or indifferent?

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.810
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, the pH remained, it's kind of a balance.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.780
It's some complex chemistry that we're

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.220
still looking at, but there were definitely

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.270
some acid ions that were released and the base

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.440
CAD ions. And so the pH basically stayed about

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.040
the same. So in that sense really

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.820
no effect. Or I would put it in

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.280
the point of there is no harmful effect that

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.310
would kill fish or anything like that. Or like

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.970
downstream the city Gatlinburg pulls some of their

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.300
drinking water supply from the Little Pigeon.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.900
And so there'd be no effect basically to the water

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.700
supply. [INTERVIEWER]: Salley, you mentioned that y'all sampled in high

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.410
burned areas, moderate, and the no burn areas. Did you

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.660
see any distinctions between the three in the streams?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.970
Can you tell what those were? [NARRATOR 2]: In the streams, we

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.690
didn't classify so much as the burn levels. That was

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.630
more for our soil sampling just due to the nature

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.630
of the streams. They're kind of being fed from a

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.200
lot of different areas in the burn. So we had

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.470
sites feeding the water sampling sites

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.920
from all levels of the burn, and the watersheds

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.220
feeding them are pretty big areas. So we didn't

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.500
classify the water so much as by burn

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.740
severity. But in the soils we have seen pretty big

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.160
differences between the hybrid areas and the

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.420
controls. So we've seen lower organic content

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.630
which we expected and a lot lower significantly

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.960
lower base CAD... [INTERVIEWER]: Okay, lower organic content. Can you explain

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.360
that to... [NARRATOR 2]: So, basically the soil horizons, the

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.300
top layer of soil, what vegetation grows

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.480
from and everything is the organic layer.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.620
And so at those high sites it wasn't even there

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.580
because it had burned completely away. And so it

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.760
can have, I'd say it has big impacts on

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.940
vegetation returning. And that sort of thing, just

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.730
because there's nothing for the plants to grow out

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.800
of in those really high burned areas. So that's

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.730
expected. That would be seen in the West

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.690
Coast as well. [INTERVIEWER]: Well, what other differences other

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.960
than the, that the organic materials burned off?

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.960
[NARRATOR 2]: We've seen this similar, what we've been

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.950
talking, about lower base CAD ions. And then also

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.580
the sulfur was a lot lower in the high burned areas.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.750
Everything was just decreased for the most part

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.440
besides exchangeable acidity which made sense

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.600
because the pH was dropping a little bit.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.320
[INTERVIEWER]: You mentioned earlier something about, you were looking at

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.910
fires out west, which are fairly prevalent compared to the eastern parts.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.900
Wildfire like this is pretty rare in the Smokies. What distinctions are you seeing

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.020
between the two? In terms of what causes them, what the results

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:42.790
were, how they operate. Can y'all, both of you... [NARRATOR 1]: Well, you've been doing

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.190
the literature review. [NARRATOR 2]: I'd say in terms of the

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.150
causes, what I've read mostly about West Coast

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.910
fires, what starts them, is the availability of

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.940
fine fuels on the ground. So things that can

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.420
ignite from anything anthropogenic, lightning

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.460
strike, it could be a lot of different things that

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.780
start those fires. But over here what really

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.990
caused this fire was just a perfect combination of

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.970
the drought conditions, windstorms, really low

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.710
moisture and then anthropogenic, obviously human

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.060
caused fire. So it's more of a situational

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.530
cause here. Whereas on the West Coast it's the

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.130
environment itself, not like the weather conditions

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.630
I guess. [NARRATOR 1]: And then from like the water quality side,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.440
out west they find that after a fire the

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.550
streams will increase in nitrogen, and we

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.290
don't see that here in the east side. And

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.780
I think that's a function, it's just out west, it's so

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.380
much drier than here. And so after the fire,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.250
and you had rains. Even though, so there was this

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.450
heterogeneity, hot burned, not so

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.360
hot burned, not burn at all. Just all kind of mixed

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.240
together in the watershed, is that the plants

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.000
basically came back pretty fast because

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.280
there's moisture. I mean, it rains here. Where out

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.650
west, the vegetation regrowth is not as quick. So

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.980
so there they are seeing more nitrogen

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.680
leaving the watersheds, and here, we think the

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.140
plants come. It doesn't matter what kind

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.700
of plan it is, so there's probably some ecosystem

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.320
influences on the type and diversity of plants.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.360
But when it comes to chemistry, it doesn't

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.190
really matter. The plants need nitrogen and they

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.310
just pulling it all up. So we didn't see

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.020
that at all. Actually, well we saw actually a

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.970
little bit a decrease actually in nitrogen.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.860
[INTERVIEWER]: Did that surprise you? [NARRATOR 1]: Well from, probably not.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.100
But that was one thing that was a

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.460
hypothesis or a question in our research because

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.640
we only really had studies from out West to

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.990
compare it to. There were a few studies that were

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.530
done at Coweeta Research Lab, which is in North

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.140
Carolina, and there was a few studies there. But

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.990
other than that, there was really nothing else to

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.480
go on. So it was an interesting research

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.460
question because I mean we really don't know the

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.890
answers, but what we suspected, what we

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.590
found was true, and so now we have actually data

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.250
to show it. [INTERVIEWER]: What other hypotheses did the two of you have going

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.580
into this

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.320
post-fire research?

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:41.110
[NARRATOR 1]: Wanna stay for your thesis? [NARRATOR 2]: Yeah, I mean the pH stuff

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:48.280
was a little surprising. [INTERVIEWER]: What was the hypothesis from your research paper?

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.930
[NARRATOR 2]: The nitrate, or the nitrogen that we

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.620
mentioned was- we had a few hypotheses that kind of

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.320
turned out to be not as true as we, not right

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.970
at all. One of them was the ammonium pulse in the

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.640
streams right up to the fire. So we kind of

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.730
expected to see a different form of nitrogen

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.140
ammonium to increase right after the fire in

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.350
streams. And we didn't really see that in the

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.230
Smokies. And that's really common in a lot of the

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.980
studies we've seen out west. [INTERVIEWER]: Why did you expect it to increase? [NARRATOR 2]: I

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.950
think just looking at the other studies and

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.600
reading what they were seeing. [NARRATOR 1]: I think when

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.820
they burn the- because a lot of nitrogen in

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.040
the wood material, when it burns, it kind of

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.280
gets released from the burning of

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.020
the wood. [INTERVIEWER]: So you did not see what you thought you were going to see? [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.270
[INTERVIEWER]: Any other hypothesis you had going in? [NARRATOR 1]: Well, there was the one

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.520
with the sulfur because it's so much

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.100
sulfur built up in the... We expected actually to see

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.440
a release of sulfur as sulfate, but we didn't see

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.480
that. So that was kind of a new thing as

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.780
well, too. So I guess overall there wasn't

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.330
really as large of an environmental impact.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.650
We just really didn't know. But I mean

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.100
I think we could say at least from our our data is

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.370
that you know the environmental impacts to soil

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.470
and chemistry were minimal. Now there's all sorts

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.730
of like plants. I think you interviewed you interviewed

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.100
Jen Schweitzer's and others, that they're in

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.750
with the plant and the ecosystem kind of level. There

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:35.270
can be some shifts there, but just some basic

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.010
chemistry, we didn't really see a major impact

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.410
or shifts, changes but nothing that would... [NARRATOR 2]: Yeah, nothing that

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:46.460
would change anything dramatically. [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah. Mm hmm. [INTERVIEWER]: So

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.230
it's been three years since the fire. Both of

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.900
you've been there several times, seeing it. Can you describe

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.000
what the recovery is like?

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.000
And perhaps even address whether this fire was

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.860
just a minor event in the history of Smokies?

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.570
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, was a pretty major event. And then we

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.480
were just there yesterday, and driving through, you

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.840
could still see the burn, the

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.350
impacts from it. So the visual impacts and

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.300
the impacts on vegetation will be decades. So

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.270
I think that that's pretty substantial

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:37.490
as far as the aesthetics. [NARRATOR 2]: And a few of the trails. A few of

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.530
the trails are still closed because the fire

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.650
damaged them to such a level that it's gonna take

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.230
a while for them to come back and be safe for

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.020
people to use, including the Chimney Tops trail

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.700
where it started. [INTERVIEWER]: Well, isn't a fire like this, in a wilderness area

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.200
a natural occurrence? So part of

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.840
the cycle? [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah, there's other

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.090
researchers here, this is not in our

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.390
area of research, but there's other researchers,

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.610
Sally Horn in Geography. And you may plan or have

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:16.330
interviewed her, but she was doing work on the

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.090
the history of fire in the eastern United

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.030
States. And there definitely was a much greater

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.800
history of fire here. And then, and this is

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.170
part of what Salley was kind of was leading to, is the

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.300
difference of what caused the fire.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.490
There was perfect conditions, dry and the wind, and

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.700
the drought but also, too, the fire suppression. For

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.670
years, there was so much fuels that were

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.520
available that it just, once it got going, it was so

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.730
hot, it just it was hard stopping

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:54.160
it. And the Park Service has a policy of not

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.880
having an intervention, whether that was the

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.440
greatest policy or not in a park that's next to

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.720
an urban center... That's that's not my, you know, I'm

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.190
not a policymaker. But anyway, it seems like that

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.500
may be something they want to rethink actually. [INTERVIEWER]: Okay,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.810
what is the trajectory of your research? You've got this, and you've been at it

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.380
for a while. Where do you see it going now?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.910
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, I think, since I'll be here and you'll be graduated.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.980
Well, I think there's been some

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.070
shifts- even though I was indicating there's

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.030
no- we didn't find any really harmful

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.570
environmental impacts, there were shifts in the

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.750
chemistry. So it would be interesting to see

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.170
over the long term if we come back to the

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.410
original kind of balance between acids

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.980
and bases in the soils, and as the trees

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.380
grow back and the organic matter build

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.560
back into the soil. How long will

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.570
that take? That's kind of an

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.570
interesting question. And then just long term

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.250
chemistry in the stream. Sometimes there's

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.340
really is really quite a lag effect, where

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.580
you may not see, at least in watersheds and

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.330
stream taking a stream sample is that there may

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.970
have been some kind of impact 10 years ago. And

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.120
then you may not pick it up for

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.800
ten years or something. There can be some lag

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.250
effects. So this is why the park has embarked on a

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.950
long term water quality monitoring program. And

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.080
that's basically what I've managed since

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.810
I've been here. I inherited the project from from

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.840
another professor that retired. And so the

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.600
water quality work in the park has been ongoing

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.900
since 1991. So long term. [INTERVIEWER]: So this is the University of Tennessee doing this

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.830
project? [NARRATOR 1]: With the National Park Service.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.180
So it's just been this long term monitoring.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.260
So really actually, the thing that's really unique

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.720
about the Great Smoky Mountain National Park

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.260
there's very few places in the country that have

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.430
such a long term data set as what we have here in

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.290
the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. The only

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.050
other place I can think of is there's a research

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.160
experimental forest up in New Hampshire called

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.480
Hubbert Brook. And other than that, so

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.460
that's really the Great Smoky Mountains National

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.870
Park is very unique.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:40.960
[INTERVIEWER]: Well kind of in layman's terms, can the two of you sort of spell out

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:46.710
what the value of this research is to the average

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.130
person out here? How does it, not benefit them

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.380
directly, but important for them to know what

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.200
you're finding and know what you're keeping track

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.240
of and why it's important to monitor the quality

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.160
of the water in a wilderness area.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:10.570
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, the park

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.780
has a responsibility to manage the natural

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.490
resources because it is a national park. And so

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.550
they want to understand if there is any

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:26.440
impacts from our research that needed them to

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:31.240
think about restoration or mitigation efforts in

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.930
the future, then our research would have

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.510
helped support the resource managers up in the

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.750
park. But there is also, too, that water supply.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.940
Gatlinburg pulls the water from the stream,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.420
so in particular there, I think that

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.450
was probably, early on was actually, the real- There

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.000
was a lot of concern by the citizens in Gatlinburg

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.190
whether there was heavy metals because we also

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.070
measure heavy metals as well too, dissolved

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.440
heavy metals in the water. They were afraid that

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.210
the water was going to be

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.240
contaminated. So early on we were

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.080
actually pretty easily satisfied the

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.750
citizens of Gatlinburg that there wasn't a problem.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.570
Their water treatment plant was going to work fine.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.930
And so there was nothing to worry about. So

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.000
there was concern from that from the citizens of

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.880
Gatlinburg. So that was from a community

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.550
effect, we're able to make people feel

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.320
more comfortable about the water they're drinking.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.240
[INTERVIEWER]: Well, your colleagues in the scientific community,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.400
did they- have you run across any research where they're

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.850
saying, for example, that the water quality after the

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.210
fire has affected, say salamanders or fish or snakes

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.450
or any other animals that would use the water? There were

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.950
a couple... Oh did you stick around, you were

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.620
there in the morning. There was a couple talks on

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:58.800
salamanders. [NARRATOR 2]: Yeah, that was interesting. [NARRATOR 1]: So, it seems like

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.990
there is some effect. I mean that's outside our

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.800
area of research. But we did see some talks

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.020
yesterday at the Great Smoky Mountains National

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.900
Park Science Colloquium. So it was salamanders,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.790
and there were some plants. So there are

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.050
definitely some impacts to the

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.780
wildlife and how quick they recover.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.260
I'm not sure.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.520
A biologist needs to answer those questions.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.080
[INTERVIEWER]: Was there anything that surprised you about any of

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.100
the fire itself, your research findings or what you

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.250
stumbled across while you were there? Any real

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.800
surprises?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:52.860
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, I think from Salley's work...

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.450
No one really has talked about

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.950
base CAD ions as being changed in the

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.890
soil chemistry.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:08.130
And so again, that's just so for laymen that's

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.340
calcium and magnesium and sodium and potassium.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.700
Potassium in particular is a plant nutrient.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:23.460
All plants need potassium. And so I guess

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.000
there could really be long term effects to the

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.600
ecosystem is that calcium doesn't

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.690
replenish quickly in the environment. It takes

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.980
decades and decades for it to build up in the

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.920
soil. And then all of a sudden with this fire is

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.610
if now we see this release of calcium and

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:49.500
magnesium and potassium in particular leave the

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:55.650
environment. [INTERVIEWER]: [inaudible]: [NARRATOR 1]: Well, it mobilizes.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.100
So basically it was in the organic, it was in the plant

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.680
material. And then the plant material burns, and

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.050
then it just becomes in its elemental form. And

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.750
then when it rains it just washes down.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:13.050
And then so just that export of those ions and

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.440
the lack of that now in the soil

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.250
could really have some long term ecosystem effects.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.470
This is why I mean kind of like lag effects that

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.170
we are not seeing any immediate

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.500
changes, except the base CAD ions. We

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.520
did see that that change. That can have some

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.080
long term effects. And I think that that

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.930
was the interesting and surprising question that

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.580
we didn't think- we were really looking

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.750
because most studies nitrogen and sulfur.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.390
So sulfur and nitrogen were the big

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.580
ones everybody was looking at. No one really is

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.710
looking at the base CAD ions. So that would be our

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.520
real new story for our research out of this. And

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.970
then continuous long term study, answering

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.450
your other questions. I think we could see changes

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.750
in water chemistry change. Or at least

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.600
comparatively to other unburned areas in the

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.010
park, as the vegetation grows back or doesn't grow

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.250
back. And we may see some long term

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.010
effects. Again is there any really major

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.930
harm? Fish aren't going to be dying or whatever,

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.540
but we do see a shift in the environmental

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:26.680
conditions. Yeah. [INTERVIEWER]: Well, we've had a fire in 2016

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.850
unlike anything anybody had seen before. You think

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.640
we'll have another one like it?

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.550
[NARRATOR 2]: From what I've been reading about it, wildfires

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.160
are supposed to becoming more and more prevalent

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.730
going forward just due to climate change and

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.710
the environmental conditions we've been seeing.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.710
Where it's really rainy for amount of time and

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.490
then really dry. And that kind of makes more

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.670
opportunity for an event like this to happen again.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.530
So I mean hopefully not in the Smokies, or anywhere

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:06.490
but... [INTERVIEWER]: So we're going to have another one. [NARRATOR 2]: From what I've been reading.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.780
People are predicting that it'll become more and

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.400
more common in the West Coast and East Coast. [NARRATOR 1]: Yeah,

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.500
I think that's a fair assumption, I think.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:22.710
[INTERVIEWER]: Well, we've covered a lot of material here.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.590
Your research and the findings and

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:30.130
projects. Is there anything that we haven't

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.130
discussed that you'd like to bring up?

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.750
Whether it's what you saw about the fire or the

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.410
emotional reaction to it?

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:45.130
Anything you would like to add to the story line here.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:45.510
[NARRATOR 2]: Hmmm.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.330
[NARRATOR 1]: Well, I think for me, when I finally

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:53.420
went there afterwards, like that month

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.140
right after the fire, just seeing how widespread

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.960
and destructive it was. It was just pretty

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.550
astonishing really. I mean, it's just hard to

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.410
imagine actually. Really. And it's going to be

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.110
a while before it recovers. And because

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.780
even now so many years out, three plus years out,

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.750
that we're still seeing the

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:23.210
impacts. So yeah. [NARRATOR 2]: Yeah. I'd say, we had a site at

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.080
the Chimney Tops, the top of the trailhead, and the

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.540
origin of the fire. And that was the most shocking

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.570
spot in the park that I saw because obviously

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.750
it's barred to visitors. And so it's just you and

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.020
whoever is helping you sample the soils. It's just so, it's

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.210
dramatic. The landscape looks so much different after

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.750
the fire.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.200
[INTERVIEWER]: Well I really appreciate both of you sharing your

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:57.190
story with us. It was fascinating. And thanks

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.850
again. And if you have any other final comments.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:00.200
[NARRATOR 1]: I think

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.160
we kind of covered it pretty

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.580
much. We appreciate the offer to have us

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:13.060
give a talk, and I hope your project goes well.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.000
[INTERVIEWER]: Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
